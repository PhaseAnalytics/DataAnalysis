# DataAnalysis
Some quick data analysis activities, i.e., coding challenges, etc. 

### Challenge One: [Here](https://github.com/PhaseAnalytics/DataAnalysis/tree/master/challenge_one)

This was an interesting code challenge that was more a demonstration of software skills than data analysis abilities. The instructions were to create a modular, object-oriented Python script to analyze a dataset without using Pandas or Juypter. 

Analysis tasks included visualizations, correlation statistics, principal component analysis, and a simple classifier. Utilized numpy, seaborn, and sk-learn to perform the tasks. 

### Structure from Sound: [Here](https://github.com/PhaseAnalytics/DataAnalysis/tree/master/structure_from_sound)

This was an implementation of Sebastian Thrun's [Affine Structure from Sound](http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/thrun-structure-from-sound05.html).

This analysis included creating a simulated environment, and deriving the gradient descent algorithm mentioned in Thrun's paper, but was not actually described in detail.
