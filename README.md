# DataAnalysis
Some quick data analysis activities, i.e., coding challenges, etc. 

### Challenge One: [Here](https://github.com/PhaseAnalytics/DataAnalysis/tree/master/challenge_one)

This was an interesting code challenge that was more a demonstration of software skills than data analysis abilities. The instructions were to create a modular, object-oriented Python script to analyze a dataset without using Pandas or Juypter. 

Analysis tasks included visualizations, correlation statistics, principal component analysis, and a simple classifier. Utilized numpy, seaborn, and sk-learn to perform the tasks.
